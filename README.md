# Mini Challenge 3 for CCAPDEV1920T2

# Quarantine Crash Course Edition
Fork or download this repository in order to test your knowledge. Test or run the application using `npx nodemon` or `node index`, respectively. The app can be accessed through `localhost:9090`.

## Directions
1. Test everything out to make sure that the application works as intended.
2. Make a copy of [`models/db.js`](models/db.js), rename it how you see fit.
3. Modify the code so that it uses asynchronous programming using `async` and `await`.
4. Find the two TODO comments in [`index.js`](index.js) and [`controllers/controller.js`](controllers/controller.js) and change the path to use the new file you made.
5. Test out the application to see if it works.
